# Password Validation Guide

## Overview
This document explains how `ValidPassword` annotation works in our application and the password validation process in general.

## ValidPassword Annotation
The `ValidPassword` annotation is a custom validation annotation that ensures passwords meet specific security requirements.

### How it Works
1. **Annotation Declaration**: The `@ValidPassword` annotation is applied to the password field in the User model:
   ```java
   @NotBlank(message = "{user.password.required}")
   @ValidPassword(message = "{user.password.pattern}")
   @Column(name = "password", nullable = false)
   private String password;
   ```

2. **Validation Logic**: The validation logic is implemented in a validator class that implements `ConstraintValidator<ValidPassword, String>`.

3. **Password Requirements**: The validator checks if the password meets security criteria such as:
   - Minimum length
   - Presence of uppercase letters
   - Presence of lowercase letters
   - Presence of numbers
   - Presence of special characters

4. **Error Messages**: When validation fails, a customized error message is shown to the user, which can be internationalized using message properties files.

## Validation Process
1. When a user submits a form with a password field, Spring's validation framework automatically invokes the validator.
2. The validator checks the password against the defined rules.
3. If validation fails, error messages are added to the BindingResult object.
4. The controller can then use the BindingResult to determine if there were validation errors and take appropriate action.

## Benefits
- **Security**: Ensures users create strong passwords that are harder to crack
- **Customizable**: The validation rules can be adjusted to meet specific security requirements
- **Reusable**: The annotation can be applied to any password field in different models
- **Maintainable**: Centralized validation logic makes it easy to update security requirements
